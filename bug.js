This React Native bug arises when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and complex components within the list items.  It can manifest in several ways, including: slow rendering, erratic scrolling, or even app crashes.  The root cause is often related to inefficient rendering, excessive re-renders, or improper memory management.  The following code snippet demonstrates a scenario where the `renderItem` function performs expensive operations, leading to performance issues.  The use of `keyExtractor` may also be inadequate if keys are not unique and stable.

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset}
  renderItem={({ item }) => (
    <ComplexComponent item={item} />
  )}
/>
```

`ComplexComponent` may involve nested components, many calculations, and excessive state updates.
